Hello, all! And welcome to my (Noah Cutler) portfolio for COMP20 (Web Development). The purpose of this portfolio is to chronicle and demonstrate my progression as a web programmer.

My favorite assignment was by far Assignment 4, the security analysis. I really had a lot of fun figuring out ways to break my partner's website.

Since day one of this course I feel like I have grown quite a lot. I think that compared to other CS courses, COMP20 has taught me the widest variety of things, from client side to server side to security. It has also taught me how to search for the answers myself. 

The most important thing that I learned from this class is to NEVER TRUST USER INPUT. This is clearly demonstrated in Assignment 4, but it also influences our code in most every project in the class.

Now that COMP20 is over, I look forward to delving deeper into security in COMP116(Computer Security) in Fall 2016.
